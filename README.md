# Payload Application Project

## Overview
The Payload Application is designed to manage and verify customer-initiated payloads, ensuring efficient data management and integration with various technologies for optimal performance and scalability.

## Key Features
- **Payload Management:** Handles and verifies customer-initiated payloads.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Akamai, F5 (load balancer), Tomcat, API Gateway, PuTTY, Oracle (Toad DB), and VM instances.
- **Data Management:** Ensures efficient and secure data management using Oracle and VM instances.

## Technologies Used
- **Akamai:** For content delivery and web performance optimization.
- **F5 (Load Balancer):** For distributing network or application traffic across multiple servers.
- **Tomcat:** As the application server for running Java applications.
- **API Gateway:** For managing API traffic securely and at scale.
- **PuTTY:** For secure remote access to servers and instances.
- **Oracle (Toad DB):** For database management and efficient data storage/retrieval.
- **VM Instances:** For deploying and managing virtual machines hosting the application.
